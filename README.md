# 🎯 Guessing Game

## 📌 Description

The **Guessing Game** is a simple Java-based console game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number. The game compares the player's guess with the computer's randomly generated number and provides feedback on whether the guess was correct or not.

## 🔹 How It Works
1. 🏆 The player specifies the number of guesses they want to attempt.

2. 🎲 The computer randomly selects a number between **1** and **10** for each attempt.

3. 🎯 The player inputs their guess for each attempt.

4. ✅ The program compares the player’s guess with the computer’s guess and displays the result.

5. 🔄 The game repeats until the number of attempts is exhausted or the maximum allowed attempts (5) are reached.

6. 🎉 If the player correctly guesses the number, they are congratulated; otherwise, they are encouraged to try again.

## 🌟 Features
- 🔢 User-defined number of guesses.

- 🎲 Random number generation for fair gameplay.

- 🖥️ Interactive console-based experience.

- 📝 Feedback for each guess.

- ⏳ Limits the number of attempts to prevent infinite loops.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Java** installed on your system.

2. 📂 Copy the `GuessingGame.java` file to your local directory.

3. 🖥️ Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the file location.

4. 🔧 Compile the Java file using:

    >javac GuessingGame.java

6. ▶️ Run the program using:
   
   >java GuessingGame

## 🔮 Future Improvements
